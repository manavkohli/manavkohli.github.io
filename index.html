						<h3>Intro</h3>
						<p>I grew up in Portland, OR and am currently studying Computer Science at Claremont McKenna College. I love to build things, and CS seemed like the most obvious way to learn, challenge myself, and practically apply something that can be abstract. In true liberal-arts-student-form, I hope to use programming as one of many tools to contribute to a product team alongside my experience in growth, finance, and fintech.</p>
						<p>I have a lot of ideas, and am willing to bet 5% of them are good. Some of the better include a basic community music listening web app, some research I pursued on binary star mass transfer, and 'Refridge-raiders', a refridgerator cleaning service.</p> 
						<p>Aside from school and terrible ideas, I've been fortunate enough to travel extensively. In the last three years I've visited 4 continents and 9 countries, meanwhile working on a farm exchange in Brazil, traveling and interning in Mongolia, and backpacking through central Europe.</p>

					<h3>California Prison Realignment, 2014</h3>
						<p>Wrote and published a paper analyzing the effect of California Prison Realignment policy on counties. The article provided an in-depth analysis of key legislation, the weight placed on county jails, and the and shift in sentencing to accomodate the movement of prisoners into the County systems. The research was published in the Rose Institute's 2014 <a href="http://roseinstitute.org/prison-realignment/">Inland Empire Outlook</a>.
					<h3>Demographic Analysis of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, 2013</h3>
						<p>Wrote and published an analysis of the social, economic, and demographic shifts within the Inland Empire. Used ArcGIS software to create visual representations of the changes within the area.
					<h3>Redistricting in America, 2013</h3>
					<p>Completed comprehensive reports on changes to Congressional Districts in New York, Oklahoma, Hawaii, and Oregon following the 2010 census. For each district within the states I analyzed demographic, political, and economic shifts as well as any geographical changes to their borders.

					<h3>Differential Photometry of V1191 CYGNUS, 2012</h3>
					<p>Observed V1191 CYGNUS' orbital period and assessed the unusual mass transfer rate between it and its secondary star. In comparing our data to previous research, we found that the increasing period was not accounted for. Considering the low mass ratio but positive rate of change of period and high rate of mass transfer, we hypothesized that mass transfer is not a one way, but rather a two-way transfer between the primary and secondary star.
					<h3>Astrometric Measurement of the Visual Double Star Delta Bootis, 2010</h3>
					<p>Observed Delta Bootis and used Astrometric measurements to verify past research suggesting that it was a visual double star. The research was conducted with the Oregon Episcopal School at the 2010 Astronomy Research Seminar at the Pine Mountain Observatory in Central Oregon, and ultimately published in the <a href="http://www.jdso.org/volume8/number1/Estrada_v8_p6.pdf">Journal of Double Star Observation.</a></p>
